# last-nba-title-players
A project to identify the last player remaining on each NBA champion.

I was interested in seeing who the last player to play for each NBA champion (as in, who from each title-winning team stayed on that team the longest in the seasons following their championship) was, starting with the first championship in the 1946-47 season (in what was then the Basketball Association of America) through the 2021-22 season. I consider two methodologies for evaluating the "last" player on each champion:
* The last player to the play for the team in a _continous_ stint (i.e., only the first stint of players who started with the team, left for another, and later rejoined is considered)
* The last player to play for the team, regardless of whether they left and later rejoined the team
